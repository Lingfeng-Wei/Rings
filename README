A code to efficiently simulate the secular evolution of a system of
bodies under the dominating gravitational influence of a massive
central body.

The main executable is "rings".  It takes various command line options
controlling the integration; see "rings --help" for a summary.

The input file for "rings" should be in the following format, with one
line per body:

m a e I Omega omega
...

m is the mass, a the semi-major axis, e the eccentricity, I the
inclination, Omega the longitude of the ascending node, and omega the
argument of periapsis.  All angles should be in *degrees*.

The output of the code is in the format 

t m a e I Omega omega
...

with one line for each body at each time, t.
